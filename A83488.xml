            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Majesty being now in His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to His City of Yorke, where he intends to make His residence for sometime, thinks fit to send this message to both Houses of Parliament.</p>
            <p>That He doth very earnestly desire that they will use all possible industry in expediting the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ireland, in which they shall finde so cheerfull a concurrence by his Majesty, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience shall happen to that Service by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, He having all that passion for the reducing of that Kingdome, which he hath expressed in his former messages, and being unable by words to manifest more affection to it, then he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to doe by those Messages (having likewise
<pb facs="tcp:133279:3"/> done all such Acts as he hath been moved unto by his Parliament.) Therefore if the misfortunes and calamities of his poore Protestant Subjects there shall grow upon them (though his Majesty shall be deeply concerned in, and sensible of their suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings) Hee shall wash his hands before all the World, from the least imputation of slacknesse in that most necessary and pious worke.</p>
            <p>And that his Majesty may leave no way unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, which may beget a good understanding betweene Him and his Parliament: He thinkes it necessary to declare, That as he hath beene so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the priviledges of Parliament, that he hath beene ready and forward to retract any Act of his owne, which he hath been informed hath trencht upon their priviledges, so hee expects an equall tendernesse in them of his Majesties knowne and unquestionable priviledges, (which are the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Kingdome) amongst which, he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured it is a fundamentall one, That his Subjects cannot be obliged to obey any Act, Order or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, to which his Majesty hath not given his consent: And therefore hee thinkes it necessary to publish, that he expects, and hereby requires obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb facs="tcp:133279:3"/> from all his loving subjects to the Lawes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, and that they presume not upon any pretence of Order or Ordinance (to which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is no party) concerning the Militia, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, to do or execute what is not warranted by those Laws, his Majesty being resolved to keep the Lawes himselfe, and to require obedience to them from all his subjects▪</p>
            <p>And his Majesty once more recommends to his Parliament the substance of his message of the 20. of Ianuary last, that they may compose and digest with all speed such Acts as they shall thinke fit for the present and future establishment of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the free and quiet enjoying their estates and fortunes; the liberties of their persons; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the true Religion now professed in the Church of England; the maintaining his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Regall and just Authority, and setling his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue: His Majestie being most desirous to take al fitting and just waies which may beget a happy understanding between him and his Parliament, in which he conceives his greatest power and riches doth consist.</p>
